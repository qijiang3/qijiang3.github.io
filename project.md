In this project, you will learn the fundamentals of creating a reproducible data science workflow. You will use GitHub to collaborate with others on code and create your own website. Throughout the project, make sure you copy all code you write in the terminal to a markdown or plain text file as weâ€™ll need it later. As with all projects, get started early, take breaks often, and consult your peers and the instructor regularly!
