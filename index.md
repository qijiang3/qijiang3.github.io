I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Health Policy at the School of Public Health, Population and Data Science Track. My research focuses on the early childhood development and the (mental) well-being of caregivers of young children living in underserved areas. Before this Ph.D. program, I was a research fellow at Stanford University (Center for China's Economy and Institutions) to evaluate and promote early childhood development services in rural areas of China.
